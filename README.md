# HTML DevConf 2014 - High Scalability Lessons Learnt

My talk on High Scalability on the #HTML5DevConf 2014, to run the sample
app just do node app.js you will probably need to do `npm install` first.

In order for Pusher to work you need to have the following env variables,
set for your Pusher account: `PUSHER_APP_ID, PUSHER_APP_KEY, PUSHER_APP_SECRET`.

Slides are on the PDF on this repo.

As a side note, if you go back through the different commits you will see
the same app evolution I demo'ed during my talk.
